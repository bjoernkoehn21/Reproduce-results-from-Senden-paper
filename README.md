# Reproduce-results-from-Senden-paper
Constituting the first step of the actual work related to the BT, the work here concentrates on reproducing the results presented in the paper by Senden et. al. (ct. https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/hbm.23913). As the fundamental approach utilized in the paper matches exactly the one applied in a closely related project by Gilson et. al. (ct. https://github.com/mb-BCA/notebooks_review2019/blob/master/1_MOUEC_Estimation.ipynb) the code is heavily influenced by and partly taken from this source. This includes the class MOU from pymou.mou_model (https://github.com/mb-BCA/pyMOU), which is adapted to meet the requirements (default input arguments) and to match the procedure described in the aforementioned paper. The changes exclusively effect the method fit_LO().

fMRI data was downloaded from https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.mc7pd, the EC-matrix from http://dutchconnectomelab.nl/ under the title 'Group-averaged binary connectivity matrix based on 50 healthy subjects. Data as used in the paper "Edge-centric perspective on the human connectome: link communities in the brain", De Reus et al. 2014, Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B. Oct 5;369(1653).' in the download section. It is not certain, that it is exactly this matrix that is used in the Senden paper. In fact, when comparing the nonzero elements of C-matrix from the paper with the EC-mask, it looks as if both matrices differ a bit (lefthand side bottom corner).

PEP 8 serves as the style guideline for the python code (and the google styleguide for python at https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html). Some exceptions were made concerning naming conventions for backwards compatibility insofar that there are a few cases where the naming breaks with the strict lower_case_with_underscores-style for abbreviations and Latin variable names (e.g. mask_Sigma, mask_EC).
